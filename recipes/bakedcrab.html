        <li><strong>Prepare the Crab Legs:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the crab legs on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. If the crab legs are too large, you may need to break them into smaller sections to fit.</li>

        <ul>

            <li>Brush the butter mixture evenly over the crab legs, ensuring they are well-coated.</li>

        </ul>
