    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of crab legs (king crab or snow crab work well)</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 cup of dry white wine (optional, can substitute with more water)</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Steamer:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large pot, add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of dry white wine. If you prefer not to use wine, you can use 2 cups of water instead.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer basket or insert into the pot. Ensure the liquid level is below the bottom of the steamer basket to avoid direct contact with the crab legs.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Steam the Crab Legs:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat</li>
            <li>Once boiling, place the crab legs in the steamer basket. If they are too large, you may need to break them into smaller sections to fit.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to medium-high.</li>
            <li>Steam the crab legs for 5-7 minutes, or until they are heated through. You’ll know they’re ready when the shells are bright red and the meat is opaque.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Garlic Butter:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>While the crab legs are steaming, melt 1/2 cup of unsalted butter in a small saucepan over low heat or in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic to the melted butter and stir well.</li>
            <li>Mix in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to add a fresh, zesty flavor.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Carefully remove the steamed crab legs from the pot using tongs, and place them on a serving platter.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the garlic butter generously over the crab legs.</li> 
            <li>Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a burst of color and a hint of freshness.</li>
            <li>Serve the crab legs immediately with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the meat.</li>
            <li>Offer any remaining garlic butter in small bowls for dipping.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy the meal!!</h3>
